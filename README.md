Title: Weather API Data Retrieval Project

Description:
The Weather API project aims to retrieve weather data using a public weather API. It leverages the requests library to make HTTP requests to the API endpoint and fetches weather information for specific locations based on user input.

Functionality:

API Integration: The project integrates with a weather API, allowing users to access up-to-date weather information for desired locations.

User Input Handling: It prompts users to input the location for which they want to retrieve weather data, ensuring flexibility and customization in the information retrieval process.

HTTP Requests: Utilizing the requests library, the project sends HTTP requests to the weather API endpoint, fetching JSON or XML data containing weather details.

Data Processing: Upon receiving the weather data from the API, the project processes the JSON or XML response, extracting relevant weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Output Presentation: The retrieved weather information is presented to the user in a clear and understandable format, facilitating easy interpretation of current weather conditions.
